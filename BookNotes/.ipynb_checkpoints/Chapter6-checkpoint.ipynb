    "TD and MC use experience to solve the prediction problem. MC methods wait until the return following an episode is known and then use the return to estimate a target for $V(S_t)$, where $V$ is value of a particular state in $v_\\pi$. Here's a simple every-visit MC method for nonstationary problems:\n",

    "\n",
    "Where MC methods have to wait until the return is known at the end of an episode to update $V(S_t)$, TD methods only need to wait until the next timestep. At $t+1$ time they'll immediately form a target value and make an update using the observed reward $R_{t+1}$ and the existing value estimate $V(S_{t+1}$. Simplest TD method goes:\n",

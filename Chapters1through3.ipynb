    "\"Reinforcement learning is learning what to do - how to map situations to actions - so as to maximize a numerical reward signal.\" For tic-tac-toe this would be something like learning how to take actions to maximize a win rate.\n",

    "\"A learning agent must be able to sense the state of its environment to some extent and must be able to take some actions to affect the state.\" In terms of tic-tac-toe this means the agent needs to be able to observe the state of the board and it needs to be able to place Xs and Os where it chooses.\n",

So the agent has to try a variety of actions and progressively favor those that appear best.\" In tic-tac-toe this could be equivalent to continually trying new moves in hopes of uncovering a better strategy than what has already been found."

    "    - Policy\n",
    "    - Reward signal\n",
    "    - Value function\n",
    "    - Environment model (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Policy describes the learning agent's way of behaving at a given time, it provides a mapping from the state of the environment to what action to take in that state.\" In tic-tac-toe, the policy would describe what move to make depending on the state of the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The reward signal defines the goal in an RL problem.\" At each time step, the environment sends a reward value to the agent. The agent's goal is to maximize the reward it receives over long period of time. In tic-tac-toe, the reward could come from winning, so the agent would want to make moves that are winning moves so that it can receive more reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Since the reward signal operates at each time step, it is a short-term value; the value function declares what is good in the long run.\" The value of a state is the total reward an agent can expect to gather over the future, starting with that state. Values indicate the long-term desirability of states, taking into account the states that are likely to follow, and the available reward in those states. In tic-tac-toe, a high value move might be one that likely leads to a winning sequence of moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"When we are making action choices, we use values as judgment, not rewards.\" We want actions that yield the highest value, not the highest reward, because these are the best actions over the long run. It's much harder to determine values than rewards; rewards are given to us by the environment, while values must be estimated using an agent's past experiences and observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"The model of the environment mimics the environment, or it allows inferences to be made about how the environment will behave.\" i.e. given a state and action, a model might be able to predict the next state and reward. We use models for planning. In tic-tac-toe, this might mean a model of the board and the other player where a move can be made in the model and the model tries to return a prediction of the opponents responding move and the reward from that next state."

    "\n",
    "This can't be solved readily through classical techniques. The minimax solution from game theory doesn't work because it asssumes a particular way of playing by the opponent, and something like dynamic programming requires as input complete specifications of the opponent, including the probabilities of each move the opponent could make in each board state. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could play lots of games against the opponent and learn some model of the opponents behavior, and then apply dynamic programming to those estimated move probabilities from the model to compute the optimal moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "An evolutionary method would search the space of possible policies for one with a high probability of winning against the opponent. In this case, the policy is a rule that tells the player what move to make for every state of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tic-tac-toe with method making use of a value function:\n",
    "\n",
    "We set up a table of numbers, one for each state of the game. Each number is the latest estimate of the probability of winning from that state. This estimate is considered the state's value, and the whole table is the learned value function. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we are playing X's, then each state where there are 3 X's in a row has a probability of 1, since we've already won, and each state where there are 3 O's in a row or the board is full has a probability of 0, since we've either lost or drawn and we can't win from that state. Make the initial values of all other states .5, to guess an initial 50% probability of winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Play lots of games against the opponent. To pick our next move we look at the states that would result from each possible move and check the corresponding win probability in the table. Most often we move greedily, picking the move that leads to the state with the highest value. But sometimes we randomly select a move from the table, and these are our exploratory moves, which allow us to see states that we might otherwise never find. \n",
    "\n",
    "While playing, we change the values of the states we wind up in. We try to make them more accurate estimates of the probability of winning. The current value of the earlier state is updated to be closer to the value of the later state. This is done by moving the value of the earlier state a fraction of the way towards the value of the later state.\n",

    "If alpha is reduced to zero over time, this method converges for any fixed player to the true probabilities of winning for any given state, given optimal play by the method. If alpha isn't reduced all the way to zero over time, then this method also plays well against players that slowly change their style of playing."

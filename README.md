# senior-practicum

This project was done as part of the requirements to obtain the Bachelor of Science degree in [Computational Science](https://www.sc.fsu.edu/)
at Florida State University.

My project was to read through [Sutton and Barto's Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html)
and take notes and implement algorithms I found most interesting. At the end of the semester, a paper on the project was required.
This repository contains my notes, code, and the final paper. My notes and code are pretty much all in Jupyter notebooks,
and the paper is a PDF. This was NOT edited for good software engineering practice, and I borrowed some pieces of code from 
other open source repositories (namely, Denny Britz's [repo](https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning)). 

For further details about projects I've done, and to see what I'm up to now, check out my [website](https://jfpettit.github.io).
